The new Calculation page has an algorithm/calculation on client and ideally that's not good practice... also all depends what is invovled, 
client and organization. However.. also ideally its also not good programming to throw around API calls on functionality that should or
can be handled only on the client. The solution has both.. since it was just an excercise project... and there is a toggle but switch that 
at any given stage a user can choose use the server or the client for calculations...
